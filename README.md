MazeProcedural-Unity​
MazeProcedural-Unity is a Unity project developed as part of an academic course, focusing on the procedural generation of mazes. The project utilizes algorithms to dynamically create unique maze layouts within a Unity environment.​

Features
Procedural Maze Generation: Generates unique mazes at runtime using algorithmic techniques.​

Customizable Parameters: Allows adjustment of maze size and complexity to suit different requirements.​

Interactive Exploration: Enables navigation through the generated mazes in a 3D environment.​

Getting Started
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Unity: Ensure that Unity is installed on your system. This project was developed with Unity version [insert version number here].​

Installation
Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:​

bash
Copier
Modifier
git clone https://github.com/B0TAstro/MazeProcedural-Unity.git
Open in Unity: Launch Unity Hub, click on "Open", and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository. Select it to open the project.​

Play the Scene: Once the project is open, load the main scene (typically located in the Assets/Scenes directory) and click on the "Play" button to start the maze generation and exploration.​

Usage
Generating a Maze: Upon playing the scene, the maze will be generated automatically based on predefined parameters.​

Customization: To modify maze parameters such as width, height, or complexity, adjust the relevant variables in the maze generation script attached to the maze GameObject.​
